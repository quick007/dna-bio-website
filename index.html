  <h2 class="mt-10 mb-4 text-3xl font-bold">Background Information</h2>
  <p class="max-w-2xl text-gray-200">"In 1989, Steven Barnes was convicted in upstate New York of a murder he didn’t commit based on questionable eyewitness identifications and three types of unvalidated forensic science. Nearly two decades later, on November 25, 2008, DNA testing obtained by the Innocence Project proved his innocence and he walked out of the Utica courthouse a free man." - Innocence Project</p>

  <div class="mt-4 max-w-2xl space-y-4 text-gray-200">
    <p>During Barnes' trial, the prosecution presented 3 (three) forms of evidence against the defendant, Mr. Barnes. First, the "criminalist testified that she conducted a photographic overlay of fabric from the victim’s jeans and an imprint on Barnes’ truck and determined that the two patterns were similar" (Innocence Project). They also compared the type of hair found in the truck to the defendant's hair, and found they were "microscopically 'similar'." The third type of evidence presented was soil samples, which had "similar characteristics."</p>

    <p>According to the Innocence Project, "microscopic hair analysis, soil comparison and fabric print analysis have not been validated scientifically" (Innocence Project). When a forensic analysis looked for fingerprints, he testifed that none of the defendants were found at the scene.</p>

    <p>4 Years later, the Innocence Project steped in. They obtained DNA evidince from the Oneida County District Attorney, and eventually, in 2007, they were able to test the DNA and find that none was left at the crime scene. After serving 20 years in jail, he was released.</p>
